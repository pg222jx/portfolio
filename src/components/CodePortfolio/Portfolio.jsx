              <img src={portfolioPic} alt="Pernilla GÃ¶th" className="codePics"/>
              <p>This portfolio, that you are currently in, was mainly created to showcase my personal projects.<br/>
              When I started to code this website I wanted to practice working with both React.js and Express.js. <br/>
              Because of that I decided to create it using the MERN stack.<br/>
              This project also made me more aware of the complexity in CSS and that piqued my interest in it. <br/>
              The portfolio will be an ongoing project and will therefore be changed and added to.
