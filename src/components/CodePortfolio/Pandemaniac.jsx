              <p>Pandemaniac is a one player game I created to give some joy and competion to my brothers during the covid-19 pandemic. <br/>
              This game was inspired by the board game Pandemania and the app plague.inc. <br/>
              It was my first ever experience with React.js and it left me wanting to learn more. <br/>
              This project also gave me a chance to play around in Adobe Illustrator which always is very fun! </p><br/>
