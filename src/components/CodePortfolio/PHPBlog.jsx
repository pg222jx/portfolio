              <p>This simple blog was an assignment for school and my first project using PHP. <br/>
              The course was about code quality and one of my favourite courses during my studies. <br/>
              I had heard a lot of bad things about PHP and this project made me understand why. <br/>
              However even if the structure of the language isn't always to my taste, I actually really liked how it made my brain work in ways it hadn't before. <br/>
              In this project I coded towards automated tests and finally ended upp with just below 100% coverage.</p><br/>
